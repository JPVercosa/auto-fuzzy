# Automatic Fuzzy Inference Systems

This repository contains the following fuzzy models:

- Automatic Synthesis of Fuzzy Inference Systems for Classification (AutoFIS - see https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11235)

- Automatic Synthesis of Fuzzy Inference Systems for Multivariate Time Series (AutoMFIS - see https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310456401_AutoMFIS_Fuzzy_Inference_System_for_multivariate_time_series_forecasting) 

- (Under development) Selected Ensemble of Fuzzy Inference Systems (SENFIS - see https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8858805)

AutoFIS is already running under scikit learn Estimator patterns. Check the example notebook in the examples folder
